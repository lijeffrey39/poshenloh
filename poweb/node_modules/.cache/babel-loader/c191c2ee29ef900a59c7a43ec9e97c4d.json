A video explanation is being produced, and the YouTube\n                    link will be placed here shortly.\n                </PStyled>\n<h2>Explanation of Loh's Quadratic Method, by Example</h2>\n                <PStyled>\nThis section is written in a way that a teacher can use to comprehensively\nexplain how to solve any quadratic equation with the method in the above paper.\n  It <strong>does not require</strong> the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra as a\nprerequisite.\nLet's start by reviewing the facts that are usually taught to introduce\nquadratic equations. \n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Review: multiplying and unmultiplying</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nFirst, let's remember how to multiply with the distributive rule\n(sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.expii.com/t/using-foil-to-multiply-binomials-4491\">FOIL</a>):\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n  &\\\\quad (x - 3)(x - 4) \\\\\\\\\n  &= x^2 - 4x - 3x + 12 \\\\\\\\\n  &= x^2 - 7x + 12.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThe key takeaway is that the $-7$ in the $-7x$ comes from adding together\n$-3$ and $-4$, and the $12$ comes from multiplying together $-3$ and $-4$.\nHere's another example:\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n  &(u - 3)(u + 3) \\\\\\\\\n  &= u^2 + 3u - 3u + 9 \\\\\\\\\n  &= u^2 - 9.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThat was nice: since we had both $-3$ and $+3$, the $+3u$ and $-3u$ terms\ncanceled out, giving something often called a difference of squares.\nThat will be useful later.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThe reason we care about this is because if we can do this in reverse, we can\nsolve quadratic equations. For example, suppose we want to find all $x$ such\nthat\n\n\\[x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0.\\]\n\nWe already know that this is the same as\n\n\\[(x-3)(x-4) = 0.\\]\n\nThe only way for two numbers to multiply to zero is if one (or both) are zero.\nSo, the $x$ that work are precisely those where $x-3 = 0$ (which is $x = 3$), or\n$x-4 = 0$ (which is $x = 4$). Note that the solutions are the things we subtract\nfrom $x$, i.e., not $-3$ and $-4$, but $3$ and $4$.\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Review: setting up for factoring</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nLet's try the reverse process for the example\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0. \\]\n\nWe'd like to factorize it into something like\n\n\\[(x - \\quad)(x - \\quad).\\]\n\nStudents haven't yet learned that it's always possible to find such a\nfactorization, but our approach will also prove to them that it is always\npossible!  By the previous section, if we managed to factorize, then whatever\nends up in those blank spaces will be the solutions. But what should go into\nthose blank spaces? Two numbers which have sum $2$ and product $-24$. Usually,\n  people try to find these numbers by guess and check.  That can be frustrating,\n  especially when there are negative numbers to try, and when the product has\nlots of possible factorizations ($24$ has a ton of possibilities).\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Insight: factoring without guessing</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nHere's a way to pinpoint the numbers without any guessing at all! If the sum of\ntwo numbers is $2$, then their average is $1$. So, whatever the numbers are,\nthey are $1$ plus some amount, and $1$ minus the same amount. All we need to do\nis to find a $z$ such that $1+z$ and $1-z$ work as the two numbers, and $z$ is\nallowed to be $0$.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nBy making the two numbers $1+z$ and $1-z$, they automatically sum to $2$. So,\nwe just need them to multiply to $-24$. How can we find $z$ which satisfy this?\n\n\\[(1+z)(1-z) = -24.\\]\n\nWe already saw a pattern like this, where we have a sum of two numbers,\nmultiplied by their difference. The answer is always the difference of their\nsquares! So, we are looking for $z$ such that\n\n\\[\n1 - z^2 = -24.\n\\]\n\nThis is exciting! There is a lone $z^2$, and everything else is just a\nnumber! That means that we can just finish solving for $z$ by following our\nnose, instead of requiring any new methods:\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\nz^2 &= 25 \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm 5.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThe two numbers we were looking for were $1$ plus or minus $z$. It then makes\nsense that $z$ has two options which are just negatives of each other, because\nboth give the same result: $1+5 = 6$ and $1-5 = -4$. And indeed, the sum of $6$\nand $-4$ is $2$, and their product is $-24$. The fact that those numbers satisfy\nthe sum and product relations means that the factorization exists, and so we\nhave found the solutions: $x = 6$ and $x = -4$.\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Example of use: a quadratic that can't be factored nicely</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nNow that guessing has been eliminated, we can actually solve any quadratic with\nthis method. Consider this example:\n\n{`\n\\\\[\\\\frac{x^2}{2} - x + 2 = 0.\\\\]\n`}\n\nFirst, let's clean it up by multiplying both sides by $2$:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x + 6 = 0.\\]\n\nJust like before, if we can find two numbers with sum $4$ and product $6$, then\nthe factorization $(x - \\quad)(x - \\quad)$ will exist, and those two numbers\nwill be the solutions. Their average must be half of their sum, and so we'd like\nto find some $z$ so that the numbers are $2+z$ and $2-z$. The product is\nsupposed to be $6$, so\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n4 - z^2 &= 6 \\\\\\\\\nz^2 &= -2 \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm i \\\\sqrt{2}\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThis is the reason why complex numbers were invented: so that the square roots\nof negative numbers always exist. (This is also why we do not need the\n  Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, and in fact, why this approach proves that\n  theorem for degree-2 polynomials.) So, there are indeed two numbers with sum\n      $4$ and product $6$, and they are $2 + z$ and $2 - z$, which are $2 \\pm i\n      \\sqrt{2}$.  The fact that those numbers satisfy the sum and product\n      relations means that the factorization $(x - \\quad)(x - \\quad)$ exists,\n      and so we have found the solutions: $x = 2 \\pm i \\sqrt{2}$. We're all\n      done, and we didn't need to use any memorized formula at all!  <strong>This\n      method works for every quadratic equation, without needing any\n      memorization.</strong>\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Postscript: proof of the quadratic formula</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nIf you really want to derive a formula to memorize, you can use this method, and\nit's very natural, but the previous section shows that it is actually\nunnecessary to do so.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nFor a general quadratic equation $x^2 + Bx + C = 0$, the solutions are\ntwo numbers with sum $-B$ and product $C$. So, we're looking for some $z$ so\nthat the two numbers can be {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} + z$'} and {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} - z$'}. Their\nproduct is supposed to be $C$, so we need:\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - z^2 &= C \\\\\\\\\nz^2 &= \\\\frac{B^2}{4} -C \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThe solutions are then {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}$'}.\n  </PStyled>\n  <PStyled>\n  The above formula is already enough to solve any quadratic equation, because\nyou can multiply or divide both sides by a number so that nothing is in front of\nthe $x^2$. However, just to see that this formula is the same as what everyone\nis used to memorizing (which is no longer necessary, in light of our method), we\ncan show how to get the formula for the most general quadratic equation $Ax^2 +\n  Bx + C = 0$. We just need to divide by $A$ first, to get\n\n{`\n\\\\[\nx^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{B}{A}\\\\right) x + \\\\frac{C}{A} = 0.\n\\\\]\n`}\n\nThen, plugging in {'$\\\\frac{B}{A}$'} for $B$ and {'$\\\\frac{C}{A}$'} for $C$ in the\nsolutions above, we get that the solutions are:\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n& -\\\\frac{B}{2A} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4A^2} - \\\\frac{C}{A}} \\\\\\\\\n& = -\\\\frac{B}{2A} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2 - 4AC}{4A^2}} \\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\frac{-B \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n\n<h2>Interesting historical links</h2>\n                <ULStyled>\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/The_Algebra_of_Mohammed_Ben_Musa2.pdf\">\n  al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala\n  </a>, by al-Khwarizmi (circa 825)</li>\n\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://archive.org/details/Brahmasphutasiddhanta_Vol_1/page/n3\">\n  Brahma-Sphuta Siddhanta</a>, by Brahmagupta (circa 628)</li>\n\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://archive.org/details/diophantusofalex00heatiala/page/n6\">\n  Arithmetica</a>, by Diophantus (circa 250)</li>\n\n  <li><a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k107597d.pdf\">Opera\nMathematica</a>, by Vi&egrave;te (1579)</li>\n\n</ULStyled>\n            </Container>\n            <Footer></Footer>\n        </Styles>\n    );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
