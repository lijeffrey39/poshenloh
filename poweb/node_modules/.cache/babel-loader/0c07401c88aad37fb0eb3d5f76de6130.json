<PStyled>\n                    In October 2019, I discovered a very simple proof of the quadratic formula.  The\n                    formal article is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06709\">publicly\n                    shared</a> on the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org\">most widely-used math paper\n                    preprint server</a>, maintained by Cornell University (<a\n                        href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06709.pdf\">direct link to PDF</a>).\n                    This webpage provides the general public with an easier-to-digest summary\n                    of the situation, together with some interesting links to some of the\n                    historical sources. A video explanation is being produced, and the YouTube\n                    link will be placed here shortly.\n                </PStyled>\n<h2>Explanation of Loh's Quadratic Method, by Example</h2>\n                <PStyled>\nThis section is written in a way that a teacher can use to comprehensively\nexplain how to solve any quadratic equation with the method in the above paper.\nLet's start by reviewing the facts that are usually taught to introduce\nquadratic equations. \n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Review: multiplying and unmultiplying</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nFirst, let's remember how to multiply with the distributive rule\n(sometimes called <a href=\"https://www.expii.com/t/using-foil-to-multiply-binomials-4491\">FOIL</a>):\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n  &\\\\quad (x - 3)(x - 4) \\\\\\\\\n  &= x^2 - 4x - 3x + 12 \\\\\\\\\n  &= x^2 - 7x + 12.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThe key takeaway is that the $-7$ in the $-7x$ comes from adding together\n$-3$ and $-4$, and the $12$ comes from multiplying together $-3$ and $-4$.\nHere's another example:\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n  &(u - 3)(u + 3) \\\\\\\\\n  &= u^2 + 3u - 3u + 9 \\\\\\\\\n  &= u^2 - 9.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThat was nice: since we had both $-3$ and $+3$, the $+3u$ and $-3u$ terms\ncanceled out, giving something often called a difference of squares.\nThat will be useful later.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nThe reason we care about this is because if we can do this in reverse, we can\nsolve quadratic equations. For example, suppose we want to find all $x$ such\nthat\n\n\\[x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0.\\]\n\nWe already know that this is the same as\n\n\\[(x-3)(x-4) = 0.\\]\n\nThe only way for two numbers to multiply to zero is if one (or both) are zero.\nSo, the $x$ that work are precisely those where $x-3 = 0$ (which is $x = 3$), or\n$x-4 = 0$ (which is $x = 4$). Note that the solutions are the things we subtract\nfrom $x$, i.e., not $-3$ and $-4$, but $3$ and $4$.\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Review: setting up for factoring</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nLet's try the reverse process for the example\n\n\\[ x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0. \\]\n\nWe'd like to factorize it into something like\n\n\\[(x - \\quad)(x - \\quad).\\]\n\nBy the previous section, whatever ends up in those blank spaces will be the\nsolutions. But what should go into those blank spaces? Two numbers which have\nsum $2$ and product $-24$. Usually, people try to find these numbers by guess\nand check.  That can be frustrating, especially when there are negative numbers\nto try, and when the product has lots of possible factorizations ($24$ has a ton\nof possibilities).\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Insight: factoring without guessing</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nHere's a way to pinpoint the numbers without any guessing at all! If the sum of\ntwo numbers is $2$, then their average is $1$. So, whatever the numbers are,\nthey are $1$ plus some amount, and $1$ minus the same amount. All we need to do\nis to find a $z$ such that $1+z$ and $1-z$ work as the two numbers, and $z$ is\nallowed to be 0.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nBy making the two numbers $1+z$ and $1-z$, they automatically sum to $2$. So,\nwe just need them to multiply to $-24$. How can we find $z$ which satisfy this?\n\n\\[(1+z)(1-z) = -24.\\]\n\nWe already saw a pattern like this, where we have a sum of two numbers,\nmultiplied by their difference. The answer is always the difference of their\nsquares! So, we are looking for $z$ such that\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n1 - z^2 &= -24 \\\\\\\\\nz^2 &= 25 \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm 5\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThe two numbers we were looking for were 1 plus or minus $z$. It then makes\nsense that $z$ has two options which are just negatives of each other, because\nboth give the same result: $1+5 = 6$ and $1-5 = -4$. And indeed, the sum of $6$\nand $-4$ is $2$, and their product is $-24$. We have found the solutions: $6$\nand $-4$.\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Example of use: a quadratic that can't be factored nicely</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nNow that guessing has been eliminated, we can actually solve any quadratic with\nthis method. Consider this example:\n\n{`\n\\\\[\\\\frac{x^2}{2} - x + 2 = 0.\\\\]\n`}\n\nFirst, let's clean it up by multiplying both sides by $2$:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x + 6 = 0.\\]\n\nJust like before, the solutions will be two numbers with sum $4$ and product\n$6$. Their average must be half of their sum, and so we'd like to find some $z$\nso that the numbers are $2+z$ and $2-z$. The product is supposed to be $6$, so\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n4 - z^2 &= 6 \\\\\\\\\nz^2 &= -2 \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm i \\\\sqrt{2}\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThis is why we invented complex numbers: so that the square roots of negative\nnumbers exist. So, there are indeed two numbers with sum $4$ and product $6$,\n  and they are $2 + z$ and $2 - z$, which are $2 \\pm i \\sqrt{2}$. We're all\n  done, and we didn't need to use any memorized formula at all! <strong>This\n    method works for every quadratic equation, without needing any\n    memorization.</strong>\n                </PStyled>\n<h3>Postscript: proof of the quadratic formula</h3>\n                <PStyled>\nIf you really want to derive a formula to memorize, you can use this method, and\nit's very natural, but the previous section shows that it is actually\nunnecessary to do so.\n                </PStyled>\n                <PStyled>\nFor a general quadratic equation $x^2 + Bx + C = 0$, the solutions are\ntwo numbers with sum $-B$ and product $C$. So, we're looking for some $z$ so\nthat the two numbers can be {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} + z$'} and {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} - z$'}. Their\nproduct is supposed to be $C$, so we need:\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - z^2 &= C \\\\\\\\\nz^2 &= \\\\frac{B^2}{4} -C \\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n\nThe solutions are then {'$-\\\\frac{B}{2} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}$'}.\n  </PStyled>\n  <PStyled>\n  The above formula is already enough to solve any quadratic equation, because\nyou can multiply or divide both sides by a number so that nothing is in front of\nthe $x^2$. However, just to see that this formula is the same as what everyone\nis used to memorizing (which is no longer necessary, in light of our method), we\ncan show how to get the formula for the most general quadratic equation $Ax^2 +\n  Bx + C = 0$. We just need to divide by $A$ first, to get\n\n{`\n\\\\[\nx^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{B}{A}\\\\right) x + \\\\frac{C}{A} = 0.\n\\\\]\n`}\n\nThen, plugging in {'$\\\\frac{B}{A}$'} for $B$ and {'$\\\\frac{C}{A}$'} for $C$ in the\nsolutions above, we get that the solutions are:\n\n{`\n\\\\begin{align*}\n& -\\\\frac{B}{2A} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2}{4A^2} - \\\\frac{C}{A}} \\\\\\\\\n& = -\\\\frac{B}{2A} \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{B^2 - 4AC}{4A^2}} \\\\\\\\\n& = \\\\frac{-B \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}.\n\\\\end{align*}\n`}\n                </PStyled>\n\n<h2>Interesting historical links</h2>\n                <PStyled>\n<ul>\n\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://www.wilbourhall.org/pdfs/The_Algebra_of_Mohammed_Ben_Musa2.pdf\">\n  al-Kitab al-mukhtasar fi hisab al-jabr wal-muqabala\n  </a>, by al-Khwarizmi (circa 825)</li>\n\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://archive.org/details/Brahmasphutasiddhanta_Vol_1/page/n3\">\n  Brahma-Sphuta Siddhanta</a>, by Brahmagupta (circa 628)</li>\n\n  <li><a\nhref=\"https://archive.org/details/diophantusofalex00heatiala/page/n6\">\n  Arithmetica</a>, by Diophantus (circa 250)</li>\n\n  <li><a href=\"https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k107597d.pdf\">Opera\nMathematica</a>, by Vi&egrave;te (1579)</li>\n\n</ul>\n                </PStyled>\n            </Container>\n            <Footer></Footer>\n        </Styles>\n    );\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
